# Adventist Learning Center

Adventist Learning Center provides quality education to Syrian and Kurdish Refugees living in Beirut, Lebanon. Teachers from around the world come together to create a safe, stable, and loving environment for the kids. It is only through the generosity of private individuals around the world that it is able to remain open each year. This simple website was built to reach a bigger audience and ease the process of gathering donations for the ALC students.
